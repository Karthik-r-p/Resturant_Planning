# Resturant_Planning_SQL

As an analyst, I am helping a business owner in planning to open a Fast food restaurant in Philadelphia üçü: 
Before opening a restaurant one must keep in mind a lot of factors like:

1)Type of restaurant you want to open.
2)Target Audience.
3)Is there a demand/need for the type of place you are considering.
4)What kind of facilities you want to offer like Wifi and online payments?
5)Do you want to offer Alcohol? Should you consider getting an alcohol licence ?
6)Do you want to offer food delivery?
7)Should you consider opening just a fast food restaurant ?
8)As part of the analysis, I have taken some questions and tried to answer them by querying the YELP Database using MySQL-Python(mysqlclient)
